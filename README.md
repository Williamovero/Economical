# Economical
## Inspiration
Help the homeless, reduce wasted food, provide cheap and nutritious options for food.
## What it does
Economical provides a catalog of food showing the cheapest elements first. People who can't afford food can just look at the catalog and find the cheapest food items.
## How we built it
We used android studio and implemented the NCR API through postman and HTTP requests using OKHTTP.
## Challenges we ran into
Formatting the JSON data and consolidating the relevant keys were a challenge.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to connect to the NCR API by using the Java OKHTTP library. 
## What we learned
We got more familiar with Android Studio, learned about API's and how to pull and parse HTTP requests. We learned more about JSON objects and arrays.
## What's next for Economical
We plan on improving the overall design.
